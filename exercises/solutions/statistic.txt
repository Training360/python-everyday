HUNTING THE RECIDIVIST Murdin Eyclone, I came to Hubris in the Dormant of 240.M41, as the Imperial sidereal calendar has it.
Dormant lasted eleven months of Hubris's twenty-nine month lunar year, and the only signs of life were the custodians with their
lighted poles and heat-gowns, patrolling the precincts of the hibernation tombs.
Within those sulking basalt and ceramite vaults, the grandees of Hubris slept, dreaming in crypts of aching ice, awaiting Thaw, the
middle season between Dormant and Vital.
Even the air was frigid. Frost encrusted the tombs, and a thick cake of ice covered the featureless land. Above, star patterns twinkled
in the curious, permanent night. One of them was Hubris's sun, so far away now. Come Thaw, Hubris would spin into the warm
embrace of its star again.
Then it would become a blazing globe. Now it was just a fuzz of light.
